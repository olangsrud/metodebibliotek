"AggrSml2NumVar","Kostra","Aggregated comparison of two numerical variables","Calculating aggregated values for two numerical variables, useful for comparison of the variables","r kontrollere","https://rdrr.io/github/statisticsnorway/Kostra/man/AggrSml2NumVar.html"
"confront","validate","Confront data with a (set of) expressionset(s)","An expressionset is a general class storing rich expressions (basically expressions and some meta data) which we call 'rules'. Examples of expressionset implementations are 'validator' objects, storing validation rules and 'indicator' objects, storing data quality indicators. The 'confront' function evaluates the expressions one by one on a dataset while recording some process meta data. All results are stored in a (subclass of a) 'confrontation' object.","r kontrollere","https://rdrr.io/github/statisticsnorway/validate/man/confront.html"
"Diff2NumVar","Kostra","something","Calculating the difference between two numerical variables Listing units with big difference, either the k units with the biggest absolute difference, or units with a absolute difference greater than a threshold Only units with value on both variables are used in the calculations","r kontrollere","https://rdrr.io/github/statisticsnorway/Kostra/man/Diff2NumVar.html"

"lm","stats","Fitting Linear Models","'lm' is used to fit linear models, including multivariate ones. It can be used to carry out regression, single stratum analysis of variance and analysis of covariance (although 'aov' may provide a more convenient interface for these).","r imputere analyse","https://rdrr.io/cran/stats/man/lm.html"
"OutlierRegressionMicro","Kostra","Finding outliers of a sigle variable (y) by a regression model","outliers are found by using a limit for studentized residuals.","r kontrollere","https://rdrr.io/github/statisticsnorway/Kostra/man/OutlierRegression.html"
"PLSrounding","SmallCountRounding","PLS inspired rounding","Small count rounding of necessary inner cells are performed so that all small frequencies of cross-classifications to be published (publishable cells) are rounded.

"ProtectTable","easySdcTable","Easy interface to sdcTable: Table suppression according to a","'GaussSuppression', 'protectTable' or 'protect_linked_tables' is run with a data set as the only required input. One (stacked) or several (unstacked) input variables can hold cell counts. 'ProtectTableData' is a tidy wrapper function, which returns a single data frame instead of a list ('info' omitted).","r konfidensialitet","https://rdrr.io/github/statisticsnorway/easySdcTable/man/ProtectTable.html"
