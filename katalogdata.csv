"confront","validate","Confront data with a (set of) expressionset(s)","An expressionset is a general class storing rich expressions (basically expressions and some meta data) which we call 'rules'. Examples of expressionset implementations are 'validator' objects, storing validation rules and 'indicator' objects, storing data quality indicators. The 'confront' function evaluates the expressions one by one on a dataset while recording some process meta data. All results are stored in a (subclass of a) 'confrontation' object.","r kontrollere","https://rdrr.io/cran/validate/man/confront.html"

"shortest_path_cppRouting","GISSB","Shortest path (cppRouting)","The function 'shortest_path_cppRouting' can be used to calculate the shortest path (either in minutes or meters) between two or more nodes in the Norwegian road network. The function also works with vectors with multiple from and to node ID<e2><80><99>s. Before the function can be used, the road network must be converted to a 'cppRouting' object that is called 'graph_cppRouting_minutes' or 'graph_cppRouting_meters' (or other with other names supplied to the 'graph_cppRouting_object' argument). This can be done with the function 'vegnett_to_R()'.","r analyse nettverksanalyse romlig gis","https://rdrr.io/cran/GISSB/man/shortest_path_cppRouting.html"
